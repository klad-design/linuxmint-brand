# Linux that feels fresh

‚ö°Ô∏è Proposed brand redesign concept for Linux Mint, offering a cohesive and recognizable identity with consistent visual and communicative materials.

We love Linux Mint and we want it to keep growing and attracting new users. We believe that _visually_ open-source operating systems are facing crisis due to the lack of comprehensive visual systems. These systems are defined by branding. Hence, to solve the issue we need to start the changes from the brand that would  serve as a  vusual foundation for the future design materials.

## ü§î Intro and motivation

Open-source software often compromises value of good design, which is strange as good design just like good software is seeking to create simple, yet effective solutions which are enjoyed by their users.

When we initially [raised the idea for the brand redesign](https://github.com/orgs/linuxmint/discussions/36), we noticed that a lot of users lack understanding on how strong brand creates a foundation for the rest of the visual materials. Therefore, our team decided to show how from a simple brand concept can be scaled across web, OS, socials and physical visuals. We believe that by closing this gap we can bring the brand experience (and hence the user experience) to a completely new level helping to appreciate the value of open-source solutions.

## üîâ Meet a fresh new concept

### Logo

Straightforward, yet dynamic logo sign that refers to Linux GUI and works as centralpiece for the proposed visual metaphor. Follows the original logo idea to keep the distro name initials within the sign.

The main visual goals that we wanted to achieve with the logo concept:
- simplify the design to increase versatility
- increase inner readability of the initials
- adjust the colours
- feels fresh and vibes

### Brand foundation

From a visual standpoint brand foundation is defined by:
- logo
- colours
- fonts

In terms of colours, current brand assets of the system are rather inconsistent, not only logo across the diffrent socials and settings has different shades but overall materials seem not to share the same colours. Take a look at the current website, for example: the top part of the website usese gradient, when scrolled header is coloured to a different shade of green and when scrolled all the way down you can notice that the logo's green is not the same as header's green. These inconsistencies are visible right now across the whole system, creating an amateur feeling around Linux Mint as a distro (don't confuse with "niche" feel).

Within our concept we aimed to show that defining a single colour palette helps with the visual consistency but also simplifies, while maintaining a systematic look across various assets and being easy to manage (since we just kept green and white).

Font is another pain point of the majority of open-source projects. Since the project is itself open, then it is logical that we want to use open-source fonts as well. We decided to go with [Geist font by Vercel](https://vercel.com/font) for the following reasons:
- it is well maintained
- has sans and mono versions
- has 9 weights and contains loads of glyphs
- open-source (_ofc_)

### Brand graphics

We didn't want to stop just at the brand foundations and designed a brand graphic that can create a brand association over time. It also allows to brand be more memorable when applied in suitable contexts.

Since Linux Mint is a digital brand, we focused on the digital assets primarily that include:
- socials (f.e. release anounces)
- banners
- website
- OS

We'll take a deeper look into the latter two as separate chapters since they are at a core of the product focus.

## üëÄ A visual foundation for the future

While many people were excited about the initiative for redisign, one of the most frequent questions we were asked about brand for Linux Mint was: "but why rebranding? why can't we just make a website/OS look different". And the answer is systematic visual consistency. Without a proper visual foundation other components are destined to fall out of order and visuals become incoherent. Therefore, even though this is just a concept, we decided to show how the suggested brand foundation can potentialy affect the other visuals components of Linux Mint.

### Website
 
Mint's website was updated relativelly not so long ago, yet it feels everything but exciting. Some would argue "why would we need a Linux distro to feel exciting" and my tak is simple: Linux Mint is the main alternative for beginner users and others lookig for a switch from Mac or Windows. Creating a right perception at the start, a perception that free and open-source is not a compromise but a win on all fronts is a very important. 

When it comes to the website, we want visually to stay minimal and modern.

### OS

OS UI is no doubt the most important piece when it comes to Linux distros. As these are just concept visuals, we still wanted to experiment not only in terms of look but also in terms of the experience.
We also designed sequentually folowing a common user path when facing a Linux distro for the first time: we start from the website, the go to the installation process and in the end face a desktop look.

![install wizzard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/497f926c-3f34-413d-bd0a-23438408d0fc)

Coming to the desktop experience, we wanted to look different from the proprietary distributions. The most common thing that you will see whn you download Windows or Mac is an image background and a pre-customised environment. We decided to change it and introduced an extra step in the installation process, where a user can select a layout they like the most: this way not only a distro switch for new users would feel smoother but the customisation aspect of the desktop environmnet will be experienced earlier in the process.

We also decided to get rid of a background image for the first load experience for two main reasons:
- feeling of new "home" - when you move to a new apartment, it is usually empty - this nudges you to set the place up the way you like it and not as a lnlord intended. We wanted to carry this feeling to DE as well
- efficiency in details - yes, background image almost doesn't weigh anything, yet still having a blank colour on the backgorund is more resource efficient

![DE 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/877e8b13-de64-457c-867e-cb775183d878)

Alternativelly, we can also apply brand graphics to the background by default that would build stronger brand associations.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Throughout the process of creating this concept, we designed loads of materials that remained uncovered here. Please, keep in mind that at this stage it is still a concept and would require certain finalisations to be implemented if community decides to implement this brand concept. If you liked it, please support the initiative but upvoting or sharing a word of support online. We hope that this concepts will help us push the brand redesign initiative, or at least it will allow community and distro maintainers to see that Linux MInt can be different.
