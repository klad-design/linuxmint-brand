# Linux that feels fresh

‚ö°Ô∏è A brand redesign concept proposal for Linux Mint, which offers a cohesive and recognizable identity with consistent visual and communicative materials.

We love Linux Mint and want it to continue growing and attracting new users. We believe that _visually_, open-source operating systems are facing a crisis due to the lack of comprehensive visual systems. These systems are defined by branding. Therefore, to address this issue, we need to start with rebranding, which will serve as the visual foundation for future design materials.

## ü§î Intro and motivation

Open-source software often compromises value of good design, which is strange as good design just like good software is seeking to create simple, yet effective solutions which are enjoyed by their users.

When we initially [raised the idea for the brand redesign](https://github.com/orgs/linuxmint/discussions/36), we noticed that a lot of users lack understanding on how brand visuals create a foundation for the rest of the design materials. Therefore, our team decided to show how a simple brand concept can be scaled across web, OS, socials and physical visuals. We believe that by addressing this gap, we can elevate both the brand experience and the user experience, helping new users to appreciate and old users rediscover the value of open-source systems.

## üîâ Meet a fresh new concept

### Logo

Our primary visual objectives for the logo redesign were to:
- **simplify** the design to increase versatility
- **improve** readability of the initials
- **refine** the colors
- **give** a more modern look

![logo_present](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9f70688-6d66-47be-b04c-f9840c86fc40)

The result is a straightforward, yet dynamic logo sign that refers to Linux GUI, since Mint can be considered as GUI-first type of distro, where users don't need to tinker in terminal. Sign also works as centralpiece (when combined with brand graphics) for the proposed visual metaphor of operating system being with sync in user, helping to discover new digital horizons and share user's vibe. 

It maintains the original concept of incorporating the distro's initials within the sign.

### Brand foundation

From a visual standpoint brand foundation is defined by:
- logo
- colours
- fonts

Currently, Linux Mint's brand assets lack consistency across various platforms. The logo's color varies on different social media and settings, and the overall materials don't share a unified color scheme. For instance, the website uses a gradient in the top section, a different shade of green for the scrolled header, and yet another green for the logo in the footer. These inconsistencies are prevalent throughout the system, potentially diminishing Linux Mint's image of a strong alternative (which it is) to proprietrary systems.

Our concept aims to demonstrate how a well-defined color palette can enhance visual consistency while simplifying the overall aesthetic. By maintaining a systematic look across various assets and focusing on green and white, we've created a scheme that's both visually appealing and easy to manage.

Typography is often a challenge for open-source projects. Given the open nature of Linux Mint, it's logical to use open-source fonts. We decided to go with [Geist by Vercel](https://vercel.com/font) for the following reasons:
- it is well maintained
- has sans and mono versions
- has 9 weights and contains loads of glyphs
- open-source (_ofc_)

### Brand graphics

We didn't want to stop just at the brand foundations and designed a brand graphic that can build a brand association over time. It also allows Linux Mint to be more memorable when applied in suitable contexts.

Given Linux Mint's digital nature, we prioritized the development of key digital assets, including:
- social media content (e.g., release announcements)
- digital banners
- website design
- desktop env look and feel

We will explore the website and operating system designs in separate sections, as they are central to the product's focus and user experience.

## üëÄ A visual foundation for the future

A common question we encountered when we proposed redesign initiative was: "Why rebrand? Can't we just update the website or OS?" The answer lies in _systematic visual consistency_. Without a solid visual foundation, other components are destined to become disorganized and visually incoherent. In an open-source system, this also leads to high maintenance complexity.

Although this is just a concept, we wanted to demonstrate how the proposed brand foundation could potentially influence other visual components of Linux Mint. This approach illustrates the importance of a cohesive visual identity across all touchpoints, enhancing user experience and brand recognition while simplifying long-term maintenance and evolution of the system's visual elements.

### Website

Linux Mint's website had a _relatively_ recent update, yet it fails to convey excitement. Some might question the need for a Linux distribution to feel exciting. My arguement would be that Linux Mint serves as the primary alternative for novice users and those considering a switch from macOS or Windows. Therefore, creating the right initial perception is crucial. 

We aim to demonstrate that choosing a free and open-source operating system is not a compromise but a win on all fronts. This positive first impression is vital in attracting and retaining new users, showing them that Linux Mint offers a modern, user-friendly, and capable computing environment.

### OS

The operating system's UI is undoubtedly the most critical element of any Linux distribution. Although these are conceptual visuals, we aimed to experiment with both aesthetic appeal and user experience.

Our design process follows a typical user journey when encountering a Linux distribution for the first time:
- website interaction
- installation process
- desktop environment

This step-by-step logic allows us to create a cohesive and intuitive experience from the user's initial interest through to their first interaction with the installed system.

![install wizzard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/497f926c-3f34-413d-bd0a-23438408d0fc)

We reimagined the desktop experience to set Linux Mint apart from proprietary systems. Instead of presenting users with a pre-customized environment and default wallpaper, we introduced a new step in the installation process. Users can now select their preferred desktop layout before first boot, easing the transition for newcomers and showcasing Linux's customization capabilities early on.

This way we want to create a more engaging and personalized initial experience, emphasizing Linux Mint's user-centric aspect.

We eliminated the default background image for the first load experience for two main reasons:
- new "home" feeling: like an empty new apartment, it encourages users to personalize their space.
- efficiency in details: a blank color background is slightly more resource-efficient than an image.

![DE 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/877e8b13-de64-457c-867e-cb775183d878)

We also made a variation with our brand graphics as the default background, fostering stronger brand recognition while maintaining visual consistency.

## üôå Support and feedback

Please, keep in mind that at this stage it is still a concept and would require further refinement for implementation if the community decides to adopt this brand concept. If you appreciate our work, please support the proposal by starring the project or sharing it with others. We hope this concept will drive the brand redesign initiative forward or at least demonstrate to the community and distro maintainers that Linux Mint has the potential for a fresh, modern look.

During the creation of this concept, we developed numerous materials that weren't showed here. We plan to release all these materials as a public Figma document _soon_.
